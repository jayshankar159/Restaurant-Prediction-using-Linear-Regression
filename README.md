# Restaurant-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project predicts restaurant ratings/revenue/sales using Linear Regression, one of the most basic and widely used supervised machine learning algorithms.

# The model learns patterns from historical data and predicts target values (for example: restaurant rating, popularity score, or expected revenue).

The purpose of this project is to:

Analyze restaurant data and trends.

Build a regression model to predict future performance.

Demonstrate an end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → prediction.
